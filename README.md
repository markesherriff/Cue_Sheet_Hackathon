# The 'Awesome Team' submission for Cue Sheet Palooza Hackathon
### Situation
A Cue Sheet is the way that screening composers get paid their respective royalties. These Cue Sheets are tedious and require the paying party to be very meticulious. Imagine making your customers go through loads of work just to pay you? And if they make a mistake then you might not get paid! 

### Task
Developers at the Cue Sheet Palooza Hackathon brainstormed simple and effective ways to fill out a Cue Sheet digitally! Our team had the great idea to combine the music file's metadata with the screening metadata to automatically fill out everything. We distributed the work load and went off typing as fast as light!

### Action
We worked as fast as we could and came together for more brainstorming when problems came arise. Not only did we work hard but we had some laughs, it was a great time!

### Result
Created a working prototype within 15 hours that succesfully merged a music file metadata with a screening metadata and filled out a cue sheet that is ready to be sent to a composer. At the end of the event, we pitched our product to a row of judges and an audience. They loved our digital solution and awarded us 3rd Place!
