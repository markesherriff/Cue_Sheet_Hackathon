# The 'Awesome Team' submission for Cue Sheet Palooza Hackathon
### Problem Set
A Cue Sheet is the way that screening composers get paid their respective royalties. These Cue Sheets are tedious and require the paying party to be very meticulious. Imagine making your customers go through loads of work just to pay you? And if they make a mistake then you might not get paid! 

Developers at the Cue Sheet Palooza Hackathon brainstormed simple and effective ways to fill out a Cue Sheet digitally! Our team had the great idea to combine the music file's metadata with the screening metadata to automatically fill out everything.

We created a working prototype within 15 hours and it was magnificant.
